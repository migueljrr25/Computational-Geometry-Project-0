– When the mouse is clicked, a new point should be added to the point list. This point should be drawn using an ellipse and include a label.
– Every point should be connected to the previously added point with an edge in the edge list. The edges list should be drawn every frame. 
When the edge is created, the edge’s printInfo() function should be called to display information about the new edge.
– Every 3 points should form a triangle that is added to the triangle list. The triangles should be drawn and colored based upon whether 
they are stored in a clockwise or counterclockwise order. When the triangle is created, the triangle’s printInfo() 
function should be called to display information about the new triangle.
